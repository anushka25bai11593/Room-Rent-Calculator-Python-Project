Problem Definition:
Roommates often find it difficult to split shared expenses like rent, food, and electricity fairly. This project solves that problem with a simple Python calculator.

Objectives & Expected Outcomes:

Build a tool to split living costs accurately and transparently.

Make the process simple and error-free.

Each roommate knows their share immediately.

Application of Concepts:

Modular functions for input, calculation, and splitting.

Python’s built-in input handling and error checking.

Tools Used:

Python

Development Process:

Problem definition: See above.

Requirement analysis: Take/validate user inputs. Show all results and each person’s share.

Top-down design:

input_details() – collect/validate

calculate_electricity() – compute

split_bill() – divide

main() – orchestrate

Algorithm:

Inputs (validated)

Calculate electricity

Sum costs

Split per person

Show result

Testing & Refinement:
Tested for all input types, with clear error prompts. Output is simple and understandable.

Conclusion:
A practical, modular Python tool for clear and fair house expense sharing.
